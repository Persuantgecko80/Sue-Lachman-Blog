            <h1>30 days since the death of our daughter</h1>
            <p>Today we marked the 30 days since our beautiful daughter died (although the shloshim ends tomorrow which of course is Shabbat).</p>
            <p>We went to say Tehillim (psalms) and my husband said Kaddish (special mourners prayer) for her. It was moving and sad to see a stone laid there instead of having my vibrant beautiful girl home with us this weekend.</p>
            <p>My heart is broken.</p>
            <p>The words on the stone are just an echo of who she was and still is for me. “אבן מאסו הבונים היתה לראש פינה” (The stone that the builders rejected was the cornerstone).</p>
            <p>Many people reject would even throw out, as they did with our son Foily who we adopted, a child with Down syndrome just because they consider them a reject, something not whole or perfect. But I have proof that they are the cornerstone, the foundation without which we would have nothing to build upon.</p>
            <p>Chaya Gittel didn't once speak badly about another human being.</p>
            <p>She loved unconditionally.</p>
            <p>She was resilient and even though at times her poor health could have pulled her down, she never showed it and always told us she was ok.</p>
            <p>Her love of life was infectious.</p>
            <p>Her determination beyond words.</p>
            <p>The rest of the stone says “The world lost a shining light. Adored by all who met and knew her”</p>
            <p>The truth is we have so much to learn from this beautiful soul and if only we would learn a small bit from her, we would live richer lives which would ripple out to others.</p>
